* I have been able to complete the required part of the assignment for the customer shopping.  For future development I would make it so the customer could continue to shop with multiple different products in their shopping cart. At this point it just lets the buy multiple items of on product with a total price. I would be nice to keep then shopping and adding more products to the cart for and overall price.

I found this assignment so much fun that I decided to tackle the manager part of. I wish I would have had more time to work on the supervisor file.*
